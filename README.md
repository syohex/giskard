Giskard
=======

A simple nodejs http server used to serve static files. 
The ideas is to implement a web server using just Node Core, including domains, cluster and streams.
Right know it just has some of the initial versi√≥n with some features like cluster and domains, but expect some updates in the near future with more.


To begin just require sinxelo, instantitate and start with a config path

```javascript
var Giskard = require("Giskard");

var giskard = new Giskard();
giskard.start("config.json");
```

The config file is where your settings are defined. Right now it just has a couple of things:

Key | Default | Description
--- | --- | ---
path | './app' | Path to the root directory where is all the static content
port | 8080 | Port where the http is going to start listening for requests
workers | auto | Numbers of workers ot spawn, auto for one per cpu
debug | object | Debugging related stuff, its used to dbebug with node inspector
